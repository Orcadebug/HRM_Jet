- Real implementation would require options data API (Polygon, Tradier, etc.)
- Flight data is simulated based on historical patterns

### Risk Disclaimer:
- This is for educational and research purposes only
- Not financial advice
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- Always do your own research before trading

## 🔄 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Package Installation Errors**:

2. **Data Download Failures**:
   - Some tickers may be delisted
   - System will skip failed downloads and continue

3. **Memory Issues**:
   - Use Colab Pro for more RAM
   - Reduce date range if needed

4. **Runtime Timeouts**:
   - Enterprise backtest may take 10-15 minutes
   - Don't close browser during execution

## 📞 Support
